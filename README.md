# Traffic Lights around the world
[Project website]( https://trafficlightandgame.netlify.app/) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sachauijlen/)

This project was completed after our introduction to Javascript, utilising all of the basic skills we were taught we had to build a traffic light. This is a common coding interview question and after completing the basics for this project I went on to program some lights from different countries in the world and also made a simple game to help hone my skills.
